## Remotely Connecting
If you are on mac, you are able to remote connect to servers on your machine out of the box. To do this, you type open a terminal in VScode by hitting "Control + shift + `".
> ssh cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu 

where zzz is replaced with the three letters corresponding to your account. After typing in the above command and typing "yes", you enter your
password that accompanies your cse15l account to connect to the remote server. If you succesfully connect your terminal window
should look similar to the below screenshot.

## Trying Some Commands
After you connect to the remote server you can practice navigating about the file system present. The list below explains the commands used in the below screenshot.
1. "ls" - Typing "ls" into the command line aptly lists the contents in the directory that remote connection has left you in.
2. "mkdir" - Typing "mkdir" and a name makes a new directory called said name. When you then type "ls" you see that you've created a new directory.
4. "touch" - Typing "touch" and a name allows you to create a file with a specific name.
5. "mv" - Typing "mv" moves a file from one locations to another. Thus "hello.txt" is moved from the current directory to the practice directory.
6. Finally by changing directories into the practice directory and listing its contents we see that hello.txt has been moved to a different directory.
