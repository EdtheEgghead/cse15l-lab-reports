  There are several things that I learned during week two and week three of lab. During week two, I learned how to launch a server on a remote server. Although I had previously run a server on my own computer during my own free time, I did not know that it was almost the same process to launch a server on a remote machine. In week three, I learned that a `.jar` file is just a bunch of classes zipped together. Though a small thing to learn, it brought continuity to an assignment in cse11 that had us using a provided `.jar` file to run several classes.
