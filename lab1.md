## Remotely Connecting
If you are on mac, you are able to remote connect to servers on your machine out of the box. Do do this, you type 
> ssh cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu 

where zzz is replaced with the three letters corresponding to your account. After typing in the above command, you enter your
password that accompanies your cse15l account to connect to the remote server. If you succesfully connect your terminal window
should look similar to the below screenshot.
